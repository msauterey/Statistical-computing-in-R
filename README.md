# Statistical-computing-in-R

This course is an introduction to the basics of statistical programming, targeted at entering statistics MA students with minimal
prior programming knowledge. Examples from data science will be used throughout the course for demonstration. Students will be introduced to basic machine learning topics such as classification, regression, and clustering methods, resampling techniques including the bootstrap, cross-validation, and permutation tests, as well as the basics of optimization. At the end of the semester students
will have:
- The ability to read and write code for statistical data analysis,
- An understanding of programming topics such as functions, object, data structures, debugging, etc.,
- The skills to display analysis results in reproducible ways.
